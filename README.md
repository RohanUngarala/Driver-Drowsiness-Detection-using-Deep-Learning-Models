# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Models

# Overview

* The escalating problem of drowsiness-induced accidents is addressed in this project through the development of a Drowsiness Detection System (DDS). Our methodology utilizes deep learning models for real-time fatigue identification via facial image analysis, significantly contributing to public safety and health monitoring.
* The models utilized in this project, including ResNet, VGG16, VGG19, Mobilenet, and Inception v3, are pre-trained models fine-tuned on a dataset comprising facial images labeled as 'Active' and 'Fatigued'. The fine-tuning process allows these models to adapt to the specific task of drowsiness detection, leveraging their pre-existing knowledge of image recognition.
* Applying transfer learning and comparing pre-trained models in DDS is an innovative approach, addressing research gaps and exploring the potential of different models.
* The guiding research question for this project is: "Can the application of transfer learning using various pre-trained models improve the accuracy of drowsiness detection systems based on facial image data?" The hypothesis is that the incorporation of transfer learning and the use of multiple pre-trained models can enhance the performance of a DDS, providing a more accurate and reliable system.
* Initial results from the project show promise in supporting this hypothesis, demonstrating the effectiveness of the selected approach. Beyond its immediate findings, the project's primary contribution is to the broader field of deep learning and computer vision. It offers a novel perspective and fresh insights into the application of transfer learning and model comparison in the context of real-world issues like drowsiness detection. The project's outcomes could serve as a valuable reference for future research aiming to develop more sophisticated and accurate drowsiness detection systems.
